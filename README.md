# MultiSurveyCatalog

Super temporary documentation, and fairly barebones scripts. I wrote these a long time ago so it's unfortunately one monster file (graphspectrum) with the helper file that formats the tables into a universal format. The way it iterates is clunky and slow, I'd like to improve it someday if I can find the time. This shouldn't require too much in the way of dependencies outside of astropy/matplotlib/numpy/scipy.
